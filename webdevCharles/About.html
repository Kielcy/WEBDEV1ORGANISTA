            <article>
                <p>
                    I’m Charles Christopher B. Organista, a 22-year-old Computer Science student who’s also navigating the challenges of being a working student. 
                    Balancing academics, work, and personal passions isn’t easy, but I’ve always believed that growth comes from pushing myself beyond my limits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Writing has always been a big part of who I am. As a former Editor-in-Chief of a college publication at Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University (DMMMSU), 
                    I had the privilege of using my words to inform, inspire, and create meaningful conversations. My time in publication taught me the importance of responsibility, 
                    leadership, and staying true to my voice. Even though I’m now focusing on my studies in tech, my love for writing hasn’t faded; it continues to shape how I think and communicate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Juggling work and studies is tough, but I see it as an opportunity to build discipline and resilience. There are days when exhaustion hits, but my goals keep me going. 
                    I want to excel in Computer Science, not just for a degree but to develop skills that will open doors for me in the future.
